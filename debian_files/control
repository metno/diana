 .
@metno_config_if ^precise(_test)?$
 It uses OpenGL for the graphics and Trolltech Qt for the user
 interface.  Diana shows fields, observations and satellite and radar
 images on a map. 2D-trajectories can be computed from wind and ocean
 current fields.  The tool also displays vertical profiles
 (soundings), vertical crossections and wave spectrum data in separate
 windows, all from preprocessed data. Preprocessing software is
 however not a part of Diana.  The editor tools consist of a field
 editor and a drawing tool for fronts, symbols and area types.
